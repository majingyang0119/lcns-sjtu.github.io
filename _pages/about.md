<!-- Welcome to the **Lab of Computational Neuroscience** ! -->

The lab of computational neuroscience at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://www.sjtu.edu.cn) is directed by [Douglas Zhou](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/zdz/) and [Songting Li](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/people/songtingli/). It involves a diverse team with expertise of mathematics, physics, computer science and biology, sharing a common interest in understanding how the brain works. In general, the research in the lab applies mathematical modeling and computational techniques to investigate principles of neuronal computation across spatiotemporal scales, including *dendritic computation of a single neuron*, *dynamics of neuronal circuitry* and *large-scale networks*, and *brain-inspired machine learning algorithms*. The lab is in quest of mathematical understanding of the brain with a close collaboration with experimentalists.
